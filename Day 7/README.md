📊 DAY 7 - Data Analysis with MySQL:

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains data analysis using MySQL. The project involves extracting data from Gapminder, loading it into MySQL, and performing aggregations and joins to gain insights.

🏆 Key Learnings
⿡ Loading Data into MySQL from Python
Downloaded data from Gapminder for:

Communication > Cell phones (total)

Population

Created Pandas DataFrames from the downloaded Excel files.

Loaded the data into MySQL tables:

cell_phones

population

📌 Outcome: Successfully loaded structured data from Python to MySQL.

⿢ Aggregations
Performed SQL aggregation functions on the cell_phones table:

MAX(number_of_cell_phones) – To find the maximum number of cell phones per year.

AVG(number_of_cell_phones) – To calculate the average number of cell phones per year.

SUM(number_of_cell_phones) – To get the total number of cell phones per year.

📌 Outcome: Derived statistical insights about cell phone usage across different years.

⿣ Joining Tables
Used SQL Workbench to perform joins between the cell_phones and population tables.

Joined on country and year to calculate number of cell phones per person.

📌 Outcome: Successfully computed cell phones per person using SQL joins.

⿤ Aggregations with Retrieval (Window Functions)
Used window functions to get the country with the maximum number of cell phones for each year.

Applied RANK() and PARTITION BY year to rank countries based on the highest number of cell phones.

📌 Outcome: Extracted country-wise insights into mobile phone adoption trends over time.

🚀 Conclusion
Through this project, we gained hands-on experience with:

✅ Data Extraction & Loading – Processing data and storing it in MySQL.

✅ SQL Aggregations – Applying MAX, AVG, and SUM functions for data analysis.

✅ SQL Joins – Merging datasets to generate meaningful insights.

✅ Window Functions – Using SQL ranking techniques for advanced queries.

**📊 DAY 9 - Data Visualization:

📌 Project Overview:
This repository contains PowerBi-based data visualizations.

🏆 Key Learnings
⿡ Life Expectancy Chart
Objective: Visualize how average life expectancy has changed over time.

Chart Details:

X-axis → Year

Y-axis → Average Life Expectancy

Implementation: Created a line chart to show trends.

📌 Outcome: Clear representation of improvements in life expectancy over the years.

⿢ Income Chart
Objective: Show variations in global income levels over time.

Chart Details:

X-axis → Year

Y-axis → Average, Min, and Max Income

Implementation: Used an line chart for different income levels.

📌 Outcome: Comparison of income disparities over time.

⿣ Rise of Cell Phones
Objective: Analyze the increase in mobile phone adoption.

Data Processing:

Joined cell_phones and population tables.

Calculated the number of cell phones per person.

Chart Details:

X-axis → Year

Y-axis → Number of Cell Phones per Person

Implementation: Used an line chart.

📌 Outcome: Insightful trendline showing the global rise of mobile phone adoption.

⿤ World Map Visualization
Objective: Display global population distribution with time slider.

Implementation Steps:

Created a map view.

Colored countries based on population size.

Added a slider to filter by year.

Included a legend for population categories.

📌 Outcome: Interactive map visualization providing a geographic view of population distribution.

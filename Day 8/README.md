📊 DAY 8 - Data Analysis with Databricks:

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains data analysis using Databricks. The project involves setting up an environment, loading data from Gapminder, and visualizing insights through charts and dashboards.

🏆 Key Learnings
⿡ Setup Environment
Created a Databricks Cluster under the Compute Tab.

Created a new Notebook in Workspace.

Attached the Notebook to the newly created cluster.

📌 Outcome: Successfully set up a running Databricks environment.

⿢ Read/Write Data
Downloaded data from Gapminder for:

Communication > Cell phones (total)

Population

Created Databricks Tables using the downloaded data.

Loaded the data into Databricks Tables for analysis.

📌 Outcome: Successfully stored structured data in Databricks Tables.

⿣ Browse Catalog and Version History
Checked the Catalog for the tables created in the previous step.

Checkpointed the Notebook to track changes in Version History.

📌 Outcome: Captured a screenshot of all tables within the default database and created a checkpoint.

⿤ Rise of Cell Phones
Joined the cell_phones and population tables.

Calculated the number of cell phones per person (total cell phones / population).

Created a Line Chart:

X-axis → Year.

Y-axis → Number of cell phones per person.

📌 Outcome: Visual representation of the rise in mobile phone adoption over time.

⿥ Dashboard
Created a Notebook Dashboard View.

Added the Line Chart showing number of cell phones per person over the years.

📌 Outcome: Dashboard displaying key insights in Databricks.

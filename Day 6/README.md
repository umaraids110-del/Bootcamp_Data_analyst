DAY 6
📌 Project Overview
This repository contains web scraping, focused on extracting structured cricket match commentary data from a sports website.

🏆 Key Learnings
⿡ Understanding robots.txt for Amazon, ESPNCricInfo, and Instagram
Examined the robots.txt or Terms of Use of different websites to understand scraping limitations.

Key Findings:
Amazon: Heavily restricted scraping, blocks all bots except approved ones.

ESPNCricInfo: Allows some pages but restricts API access and live data scraping.

Instagram: Blocks almost all automated scraping attempts and requires authentication.

Conclusion: Respecting robots.txt is crucial to avoid legal and ethical issues when scraping data.

📌 Outcome: Summary of robots.txt rules for scraping constraints.
